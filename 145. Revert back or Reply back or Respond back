Revert back/ Reply back/ Respond back


Let's understand  - Using the word 'Revert' to imply a response is totally wrong, as 'revert' means returning to its original state.
                               - Using 'back' with the terms 'reply' or 'respond' is not correct as both the terms themselves mean something is going in return.
