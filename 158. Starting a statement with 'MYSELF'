Starting a statement with 'MYSELF'


Let's understand - 'Myself' is a reflexive pronoun and as per the rule of English grammar, a sentence cannot begin with a reflexive pronoun.

Many people say that an accomplished/ experienced person can start her/ his introduction with 'MYSELF'. This self-proclaimed rule doesn't hold water.

Incorrect Usage- Myself Kartikeya Srivastava, I am a student of B.Tech pre-final year.
Correct Usage-    My name is / I am Kartikeya Srivastava, I am a student of B.Tech pre-final year.
