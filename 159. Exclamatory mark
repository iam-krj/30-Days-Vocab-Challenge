Putting multiple exclamatory marks (!)


Let's understand: An exclamatory mark is used to show sudden emotion of joy or grief.
This mark can be used to greet (especially in the mail). However, putting more than one exclamatory mark will not do any good to your mail (it is just your emotion).

Incorrect Usage: Greetings to you !!!!!

Correct Usage: Greetings to you!
